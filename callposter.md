# Call for Posters

The International Conference on Scalable Scientific Data Management (SSDBM) 2025 is a premier forum for researchers, practitioners, and experts to discuss the latest advancements in scalable scientific data management.  Building on the strong foundation of SSDBM, the 2025 conference broadens its scope to encompass all areas of scalable scientific data management, fostering a dynamic environment for the exchange of cutting-edge research, practical system designs, implementations, and evaluations.  SSDBM 2025 will feature a single-track program to maximize interaction and discussion, including invited talks, panels, and demonstrations.  Hosted by The Ohio State University, SSDBM 2025 continues its tradition of promoting collaboration and innovation in scientific data management, high-performance data analysis, and the management of distributed datasets.

The poster session provides a valuable opportunity for researchers to present ongoing work, discuss novel problems and solutions, and receive insightful feedback from the SSDBM community.  Accepted posters will also be featured in a short presentation slot during the conference.  Posters will undergo a light review for scope and presentation quality.  The number of accepted posters is limited by space constraints.

**Why Submit a Poster?**
- Showcase Your Research: Present your work and receive valuable feedback.
- Networking: Connect with prominent researchers and potential mentors.
- Shape the Future: Contribute to the development of next-generation research infrastructure for scalable data management.
- Student Opportunities: Compete for travel awards (up to $1500) and prizes.
- Best Poster Competition: All student posters are automatically entered into the Best Poster Competition. The winner will receive recognition at the conference.


## Submission Guidelines

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished work. Submissions should include:
- **Extended abstract**: A maximum of 2 pages, in ACM format (using the generic "sigconf" sample from [ACM template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) LaTex users are recommended to use \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart} conﬁguration. 
- **Poster Draft**:  One A0-size sheet, vertical layout (preferred) or horizontal layout.
- **Single-blind Review**: Include authors' names and affiliations on the first page.  Please adhere to the ACM Policy on Authorship and generative AI tools: [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship).
- **Student Competition Indication**:  If the first author is a student and wishes to participate in the student poster competition, please clearly indicate this during submission.

## Special Opportunity:  StoreHub Community Workshop & Student Travel Awards

SSDBM 2025 is excited to announce a synergistic collaboration with the **StoreHub Community Workshop**! StoreHub is an NSF-funded initiative focused on creating a publicly accessible, data management and storage-centric cluster tailored to the diverse needs of the data storage research community. The workshop aims to gather community input and foster collaboration in the rapidly evolving field of data storage research.

**StoreHub Travel Awards**:  To encourage community participation and engagement with the StoreHub initiative, we are offering travel awards of up to $1500 for members submitting posters to SSDBM 2025.  These awards support attendance at both SSDBM 2025 and the StoreHub Community Workshop.  To be considered for a travel award, please indicate your interest during the poster submission process and complete the [StoreHub Community Insight Survey](https://forms.gle/c6fmQkiSrCYWQMij9). This is a fantastic opportunity to contribute to the future of storage research, especially in the context of the increasing demands of AI.

**Other Important Notes**

- Posters (extended abstracts) will not be included in the conference proceedings.
- At least one author must register for the Technical Program and present the poster in person at the conference for it to be included in the program or student poster competition.
- For full conference details, including the detailed scope and other submission types, please see the conference website: [https://ssdbm.org/2025](https://ssdbm.org/2025)
